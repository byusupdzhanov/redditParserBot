# redditParserBot
It is not final version. Hmm... maybe it is <b>version 1.0.0</b>

<h2> How it works?</h2>
This bot parse memes from Reddit r/memes. 
In future I will add more features like choosing subreddit to parse and adding to diff telegram channels.

If you want, you can inform me <a href="https://t.me/dontbesoseriouspls">here</a> about writing docs etc.
